Spending too much time out in California
And for all this time I've been waiting for you
Will you call me a cab so I can finally get back?
Never felt that, I've never felt that

All looks the same from the inside
Wanted to change, it took a big fight
Call it a bluff, you'll see it real time
Wish you could see it's been a rough ride

I swear I tried
I swear I tried

Got a fragile heart always thought you knew that
And you said from the start, "Guess that's how we do that"
Know you're stuck in the past and tired of living so fast
It's not the plan, you wouldn't understand

All looks the same from the inside
Wanted to changе, it took a big fight
Call it a bluff, you'll see it real time
Wish you could see it's been a rough ride
You might also like
I swеar I tried
I swear I tried

Keepin' it quiet till I hit back and I know
They won't listen till I start to crack
And I pick up the pieces of what they left
And I know
Keepin' it quiet till I hit back and I know
They won't listen till I start to crack
And I pick up the pieces of what they left
And I know

They'll never know
They'll never know
They'll never know
They'll never know
